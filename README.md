# TRADERS LAB Backend

This is a tryout project to make tests on connectivity with Flutter Traders Lab App (https://github.com/Ruvo99/TradersLab_mobile_tryout)

This project was also deployed to the internet via pythonanywhere(https://www.pythonanywhere.com/): http://ruvo99.pythonanywhere.com/ 

The only output right now is a JSON object, so we can try out that Flutter can catch this answers from this site and use them.
